                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><strong>DearBoss</strong> takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously.
                        This privacy policy, which we adapted from a policy originally provided by Automattic
                        (WordPress.com), describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our
                        websites. Please read this notice very carefully.</p>
                    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                    <p>Like most website operators, <strong>DearBoss</strong> collects non-personally-identifying
                        information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                        browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
                        request. <strong>DearBoss</strong> purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
                        is to better understand how <strong>DearBoss</strong> visitors use its website. From time to
                        time, <strong>DearBoss</strong> may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                        aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <p><strong>DearBoss</strong> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
                        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. <strong>DearBoss</strong> does not use such information to
                        identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same
                        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                    <p>Certain visitors to <strong>DearBoss</strong> websites choose to interact with
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> in ways that require <strong>DearBoss</strong> to gather
                        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
                        visitors who sign up for <strong>DearBoss.id</strong> to provide a username and email address.
                        In each case, <strong>DearBoss</strong> collects such information only insofar as is necessary
                        or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> . <strong>DearBoss</strong> does not disclose personally-identifying
                        information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
                        personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
                        certain website-related activities.</p>
                    <h2>Google Login Data</h2>
                    <p>When you login using google, we only collect your email address, public data (such as your name),
                        and not other data. We use this email and google id to identify you as a user. We use your email
                        address that you use on google to receive reset password info, and additional updates from
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong>.</p>
                    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
                    <p>If you wish to delete your data that you provideed from facebook login, you can fill this <a
                            href="#">Form</a></p>
                    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                    <p><strong>DearBoss</strong> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
                        For instance, <strong>DearBoss</strong> may monitor the most popular collections on
                        <strong>DearBoss.id</strong>. <strong>DearBoss</strong> may display this information publicly
                        or provide it to others. However, <strong>DearBoss</strong> does not disclose
                        personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                    <p><strong>DearBoss</strong> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                        information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i)
                        need to know that information in order to process it on <strong>DearBoss</strong>'s behalf or to
                        provide services available at <strong>DearBoss</strong> 's websites, and (ii) that have agreed
                        not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
                        may be located outside of your home country: by using <strong>DearBoss</strong>'s websites, you
                        consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to
                        buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the
                        business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if <strong>DearBoss</strong> or substantially all
                        of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that <strong>DearBoss</strong> goes out of
                        business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred
                        or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
                        acquiror of <strong>DearBoss</strong> may continue to use your personal and non-personal
                        information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, <strong>DearBoss</strong> will not rent
                        or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
                    <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                        personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
                        protect the property or rights of <strong>DearBoss</strong>, third parties or the public at
                        large. If you are a registered user of a <strong>DearBoss</strong> website and have supplied
                        your email address, <strong>DearBoss</strong> may occasionally send you an email to tell you
                        about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support
                        email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
                        help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
                        unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
                        personally-identifying information.</p>
                    <p>You should also be aware that if you submit information to chat rooms,forums or message boards
                        such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might
                        have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of
                        receiving unwanted communications.</p>
                    <h2>Cookies</h2>
                    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
                        visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> uses cookies to help <strong>DearBoss</strong> identify and track
                        visitors, their usage of <strong>DearBoss</strong> websites, and their website access
                        preferences. <strong>DearBoss</strong> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
                        computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using <strong>DearBoss</strong>'s
                        websites, with the drawback that certain features of <strong>DearBoss</strong>'s websites may
                        not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                    <h2>Ads</h2>
                    <p>Ads appearing on any <strong>DearBoss</strong> websites may be delivered to users by advertising
                        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each
                        time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use
                        your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
                        advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the
                        use of cookies by <strong>DearBoss</strong> and does not cover the use of cookies by any
                        advertisers.</p>
                    <h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
                    <p>This privacy policy only applies to information collected by <strong>DearBoss</strong>. This
                        privacy policy does not apply to the practices of companies that <strong>DearBoss</strong> does
                        not own or control, or employees that <strong>DearBoss</strong> does not manage. A
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> website may contain links to third party websites. Any information you
                        provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of
                        those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you
                        visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable
                        restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure
                        of your personally-identifying information by any third party.</p>
                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and personally
                        identifying-information described above is stored on restricted database servers.</p>
                    <h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
                    <p>If we ever send you information by email concerning new products, services or information that
                        you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address by which you may
                        request no further notices.</p>
                    <h2>Address Book Data</h2>
                    <p>Any external address book data (email contacts, etc.) that a user voluntarily gives
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> access to will only be used for the described feature (looking up
                        friends, etc.), and will not be stored or repurposed.</p>
                    <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, <strong>DearBoss</strong> may change its privacy
                        policy from time to time, and in <strong>DearBoss</strong> sole discretion.
                        <strong>DearBoss</strong> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
                        its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will
