                    <h2>Accepting the Terms of Service</h2>

Please read these terms of service ("Agreement") carefully before using the Site or any services provided on the Site (collectively, "Services"). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Services. The Services are accessed by You ("Subscriber" or "You") under the following terms and conditions:</p>

                    <h3>1. Access to the Services</h3>
                    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, <strong>DearBoss</strong> may offer to provide the Services, as described more fully on the Site, and which are selected by Subscriber, solely for Subscriber's own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. Services shall include, but not be limited to, any services <strong>DearBoss</strong> performs for Subscriber, as well as the offering of any Content (as defined below) on the Site. <strong>DearBoss</strong> may change, suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or Content. <strong>DearBoss</strong> may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict Subscriber's access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. <strong>DearBoss</strong> reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting revised Terms of Service on the Site and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the Site. Subscriber shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.

Subscriber also certifies that it is legally permitted to use the Services and access the Site, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Site. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Site is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p><strong>DearBoss</strong> will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Site and Services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

Every reasonable step will be taken by <strong>DearBoss</strong> to minimize such disruption where it is within <strong>DearBoss</strong>'s reasonable control.</p>
                    <p>You agree that neither <strong>DearBoss</strong> nor the Site will be liable in any event to you or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Site, the service, your Subscriber Content or other Content.</p>
